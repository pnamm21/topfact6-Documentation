# Use "Enter" to Move to the Next Field in Search Dialog

**Why this option?**

The "Enter as Tab" option allows users to navigate forms or search dialogs more efficiently by using the Enter key to move to the next field. This improves the speed of data entry and eliminates the need to switch between the keyboard and mouse, enhancing user productivity.

**Functionality:**

When enabled, this feature makes the Enter key behave like the Tab key, allowing users to jump from one input field to the next. This is especially useful in search dialogs where multiple fields need to be filled in, as it speeds up the process by allowing users to stay on the keyboard without needing to press the Tab key.

**Description:**

In the program, this feature is controlled by the following setting:

* **cbUseEnterAsTab.Checked**: This reflects the value of `AppData.AppUserSettings.MyWorkOptions.UseEnterAsTabInSearch`. When this option is active, pressing Enter in a search field moves the focus to the next field instead of triggering the search or an action.

This setting is ideal for users who prefer keyboard navigation and want to enhance their workflow when filling out multiple fields in search forms.
